1) Source Code: .java
2) Byte Code: .class
3) Executable Code: depends on OS E.g .ctxt in windows via Bluej IDE/ Notepad

(1) compile --> (2) Interpreter --> (3)

cmd to compile ur java file   :  javac filename.java 
cmd to run ur java program    :  java classname
cmd to compile all java files :  javac *.java

NOTE: 
A filename and classname can be different but in that case the classname cannot be made public.
But we mainly do classname same as filename such that user don't need to get the source code to see the classname and then execute the code via cmds.
