            NOTES & INFO
---------------------------------------

JAVA:  
  - High level Programming Language based on Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) 
  - Multiuser System
  - Platform independent

Note: OOP emphasizes on DATA PROTECTION and code reusability.

Core java- application and oop
Advance java- servlets applets

JDK - Java Development Kit is a bundle of software development tools used for building various Java apllications such as, servlets, applets
      And also, for compiling, debugging and executing Java programs.
      It contain JRE to execute the software.
      
JRE - Java Runtime Environment. It is used to execute java programs.
      JRE is made up of JVM

JVM - Java Virtual Machine. 
      It is an integral part of JRE
      It executes the java programs
      JVM is platform dependent
      It translates the byte code ( .class files ) into an executable code. This executable code is different in different platforms or OS.

1) Source Code: .java
2) Byte Code: .class
3) Executable Code: depends on OS E.g .ctxt in windows via Bluej IDE/ Notepad

(1) compile --> (2) Interpreter --> (3)

cmd to compile ur java file   :  javac filename.java 
cmd to run ur java program    :  java classname
cmd to compile all java files :  javac *.java

NOTE: 
A filename and classname can be different but in that case the classname cannot be made public.
But we mainly do classname same as filename such that user don't need to get the source code to see the classname and then execute the code via cmds.

CLA: Command Line Arguments
java className "argument 1" "argument 2"
OR java className this is an argument.
Like these we pass CLA in terminals.
